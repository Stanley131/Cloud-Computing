### What is about ?
  – How to use a Cloud as a compute node?
  – How to use cloud to design an Internet scale application? – How to process a very large amount of data?
  – How to build your own cloud using open source?

### Concepts: Building Blocks
  – Virtualization, Containers, Serverless
  – Peta-byte scale storage systems
  – Event and messaging systems (Kafka)
  – noSQL datastore (Cassandra, mongo, DynamoDB,...) – Elastic Search
  – Compute in a cluster
  – Intelligent AI applications

### What is Cloud?
  - Allows users to request computing/storage resources through web interfaces 
  - You do not need to own or install or manage these resources.
  - Pay as you go - Resources on-demand
  - **Elastic**: Use as much as you want or as less as you want
    - Users can assume infinite amount of compute and storage resources are available.
    - Users can request resources when and what they need and release/remove resources
### when they don’t need.
  - Compute and storage resources are now treated as software entities.

### Essential Characteristics
  - On-demand self-service
  - Broad network access
  - Resource pooling
  - Rapid elasticity
  - Measured Service
### Services Model
  - Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS): The consumer does not manage or control the underlying
      cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even 
      individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific 
      application configuration settings.
  - Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS): The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the
     cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages 
      and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud
      infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over 
      the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.
  - Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): The consumer does not manage or control the underlying 
    cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, deployed applications, and
    possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).

### Deployment Models
  - Private cloud. The cloud infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by 
     the organization or a third party and may exist on premise or off premise.
  - Community cloud. The cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific
    community that has shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance 
     considerations). It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premise 
     or off premise.
   - Public cloud. The cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry 
      group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services.
   - Hybrid cloud. The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public)
     that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables 
     data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load-balancing between clouds).
### Cloud Computing Economics
   - load varying with time 
   - Demand unknown in advance 
   - Extreme elasticity
   - Save money 

### Example 
  - IaaS: Amazon EC2 
  - PaaS: Google AppEngine/Microsoft Azure 
  - Saas: salesforce.com
