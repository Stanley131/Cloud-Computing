  - Cloud computing is a service 
  
 ### What is virtulization 
  - creation of vitual version of something such as a server, network, storage 
  
 ### Advantage 
  - cool down, power saving 
 
 ### Types of virtulization 
  - hardware virtulization 
  - Full Virtualization 
  - Paravirtualization 
  - Operatinf System level servers 

### Hypervisor and VMM
  - Hypervisor runs on bare metal machine
  - Functionality/role of hypervisor is dependent of type of virtualization
  - Virtualize all resources 
    - Ring is priority level 
    - Ring 0: Hypervisor always runs on this level
