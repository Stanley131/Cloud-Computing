# DevOps 
1. Docker on AWS 
  - The painful way: Run and Manage your own Docker "Swarm" on EC2 
  - ECS Architechture: Container Instance. 
2. ECS Example (Elatic Container Service)
  - Enviroment -> Docker-> Docker images -> Containter Registry
    -> ECS  -> Elastic Load Balancer 
  - Example: lambda functions run on Dockers 
3.DevOps 
  - Devops is a set of practices that automates the processes
    between software development and IT teams, in order that they 
    can build,test, and release software faster and more reliably

4. Release Processes stages 
    1. Source:  
        - check-in source code such as .java files 
        - peer review new code 
    2. Build: 
        - compile code, unit tests, Style checkers, 
          Create container images and function deployment 
          packages 
    3. Test:
        - Integration tests with other systems, load testing 
          UI tests, security testing
    4. Production: 
        - Deployment to production enviroments, monitor code in
          production to quickly detect errors. 
5. CodePipeline AWS 
  - So Cool 
  - difference between automation engineer and DevOps 
  - DevOps: 
    - automation: build, testing, releasing, deployment...
    - Cultural changes
    - architecture, 
    - security 
    - communication 
  - Automation: 
    - automation deployment processes 
    - Home automation, 
    - Desktop automation 
    - Tickets workflow 
    - Tickets 
    - Spam Control 
  - automations can help to reduce mistakes
6. Infrastructure as Code 
  - As your infrastructure gets more complex, the only way to reduce its 
    complexity is to automate them and build pipelines 
  - AWS cloudformation 
    - infrastructure as code 
    - infrastructure, configuration, and security all encoded 
      in config files called "templates"
    - reproducible infratruture safely and reliably 
    - all organizations use piplelines 
  - AWS has over 100 services 
  - Local stack: local stack, local AWS, what the hell is this?
7. mate them and build pipelines 
  - cloud-pipepline.yaml
  - yaml is cleaner and easier than json: different stages
